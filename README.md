# The GAP package QuimpGrp

This package provides a databse for all <ins>**qu**</ins>asiprimitive, <ins>**imp**</ins>rimitive permutation
groups of degree at most 4095.

## Installation

Due to the size of the library, the quimp groups are packaged in 4 files
called QUIMPN.tar.bz2, where N=1,2,3,4,5 and they can be found in the main
folder of this package. Using for example `tar -xf QUIMP1.tar.bz2` unpacks
the groups compressed in `QUIMP1.tar.bz2` into the subfolder `lib/`. Please unpack all five `.tar.bz2`-folders before using the
library.
